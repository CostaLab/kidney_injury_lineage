### Source code for the paper: Lineage tracing reveals transient phenotypic adaptation of tubular cells during acute kidney injury

#### Description:
The analysis of the project uses the single cell transcriptome analysis pipeline: [https://github.com/CostaLab/scrna_seurat_pipeline](https://github.com/CostaLab/scrna_seurat_pipeline)(83d2eb7d7595d269c33e29f1295bed69d8fbe804)

We include only the configuration files for the running of the code along with the necessary scripts for the analysis. Some figures are directly derived from the pipeline outputs. The rest of the figures scripts are included in the `figures` folder.


The data is not included in this repository. Please find them in the GEO repository: [GSE207020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE207020)
